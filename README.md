# My_RPG

## Introduction
This is the last student-project of my 1st year
and with a team of 4 developpers, including me,
we made a RPG game

## Requirements
- GCC
- Makefile
- CSFML Library

## Usage
Compile the project :
```
make
```
Launch the game without any arguments :
```
./my_rpg
```

The program will ask your name so type it
or run the game with your name :
```
echo "your_name" | ./my_rpg
```

If something is wrong check help with :
```
./my_rpg -h
```
